								<h3>Who doesn't like games? Well I love to play games....</h3>
									<p>Well, I don't have a gaming channel on youtube!!, Do I need so?. As I said I love playing games, My longest hour for playing game is 9hrs!!. Yes, 9 hours I played  games without getting up from my seat. Mostly I like to play action adventure games (story mode). So far I have played GTA 5, FARCRY 5, ASSASSIN'S CREED ODYSSEY, TOM CLANCY'S GHOST RECON WILDLANDS, BATTLEFIELD 5, MIRROR'S EDGE, NFS: MOST WANTED 2012, MASS EFFECT: ANDROMEDA.</p>			<br>
									<p>Hmm... it's looking like I have played only a few games, Right?. Well I started playing games from 2019 before that I didn't  my own laptop and now I got my Dell G3. I can't say that it's a fully functionable gaming laptop but still I'm able to manage to play games on it.</p>

							<h1>< / PROGRAMMING ></h1>
								<p>I'm very interested in programming from a very young age. I always wanted to learn C, C++, Python, Java, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Internet of Things, php, MySQL, Web Development, Web Designing...</p>
								<p>I know these are lot of things but what can I do? - I'm very ambitious about these all...</p>
								<p>Also I'm learning web development/designing, so that I can make money from internet by helping others who are in indeed.</p>
								<p>Until now I'm familiar with C Programming and python. Still I'm learning all of these and I'm very confident that I'm gonna make it to my goal soon...</p>

							<h1>GAME PROGRAMMING AND DESIGNING</h1>
								<p>As I said you earlier, I'm very interested in playing games and coding, Which gave me interest to learn and execute game programming and designing. I love to play mostly action adventure  games, where I want to construct a game upon it - a very big game full of adventure, action and  suspense's. I have a zero knowledge in it but I'm not gonna step back from it.</p>
								<p>I'm gonna learn it not now but soon....</p>

					<h1>PHOTOGRAPHY</h1>
					<h3>Do you have a hobby of PHOTOGRAPHY?</h3>
					<p>I don't know about you, but I have a hobby of photography since 2013. From that time I use to take photo's of nature and some portrait's.... I have almost clicked 1000's of pictures. I have a Canon EOS 600D which is quite a good dslr.</p>
					<p>(Well I don't have much about it to share. Let's get on to my next interest. I will update it as soon as I find something interesting)</p></div>

				<section class="interest" id="photoshop">
					<img class="img6" src="images/photoshop.webp">
						<div>
							<h1>PHOTOSHOP</h1>
							<h3>Editing in Photoshop is one of my hobby too....</h3>
							<p>What will you do after clicking a picture? - Do you directly post it on social media or in your blog?. Well I don't do that, I do give some touch up's to my picture's as you know all the click's won't be perfect. I just remove unnecessary from background, If so needed I add up some effects such as shades, sunlight, etc..</p>
							<p>From how long am I doing this editing in photoshop? - since from the time I started photography in 2013.</p>

				<section class="interest" id="robotics">
					<img class="img7" src="images/robotics.webp">
						<div>
							<h1>ROBOTICS</h1>
							<p>Here is my favorite part. I'm very much interested in robotics, My dream ambition is to make a human robot which exactly thinks like a human. Well, I'm not gonna make a robot which replace's human's race - I just want to make a robot which makes man kind easier not more than that.</p>
							<p>My mother always use to say me that when I was a small kid - I use to play with remote controlled toys which I used to break it in 2 - 3 days from the day I brought it from store..., Who doesn't do that? - everyone does it in their childhood but I'm a little different I use to break it because I was very curious to know that  "how does this work?", this lead me to study about robotics. From my childhood I was very interested in these things as well as technology....</p>
